# Neural Network Challenge 2

## Background
You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.

## Before You Begin
Before starting the Challenge, be sure to complete the following steps:

1. Create a new repository for this project called `neural-network-challenge-2`. Do not add this Challenge assignment to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your local Git repository, add the starter file `attrition.ipynb` from your file downloads.
4. Push these changes to GitHub.
5. Upload `attrition.ipynb` to Google Colab and work on your solution there.
6. Make sure to periodically download your file and push the changes to your repository.

## Instructions
Open the starter file in Google Colab and complete the following steps, which are divided into three parts:

### Part 1: Preprocessing
1. Import the data and view the first five rows.
2. Determine the number of unique values in each column.
3. Create `y_df` with the `attrition` and `department` columns.
4. Create a list of at least 10 column names to use as X data. You can choose any 10 columns youâ€™d like EXCEPT the `attrition` and `department` columns.
5. Create `X_df` using your selected columns.
6. Show the data types for `X_df`.
7. Split the data into training and testing sets.
8. Convert your X data to numeric data types however you see fit. Add new code cells as necessary. Make sure to fit any encoders to the training data, and then transform both the training and testing data.
9. Create a `StandardScaler`, fit the scaler to the training data, and then transform both the training and testing data.
10. Create a `OneHotEncoder` for the `department` column, then fit the encoder to the training data and use it to transform both the training and testing data.
11. Create a `OneHotEncoder` for the `attrition` column, then fit the encoder to the training data and use it to transform both the training and testing data.

### Part 2: Create, Compile, and Train the Model
1. Find the number of columns in the X training data.
2. Create the input layer. Do NOT use a sequential model, as there will be two branched output layers.
3. Create at least two shared layers.
4. Create a branch to predict the `department` target column. Use one hidden layer and one output layer.
5. Create a branch to predict the `attrition` target column. Use one hidden layer and one output layer.
6. Create the model.
7. Compile the model.
8. Summarize the model.
9. Train the model using the preprocessed data.
10. Evaluate the model with the testing data.
11. Print the accuracy for both department and attrition.

### Part 3: Summary
Briefly answer the following questions in the space provided:

1. Is accuracy the best metric to use on this data? Why or why not?
2. What activation functions did you choose for your output layers, and why?
3. Can you name a few ways that this model could be improved?
